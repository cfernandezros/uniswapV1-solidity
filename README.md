# uniswapV1-solidity
Uniswap V1 dapp (just exchange and token smart contracts, no factory implemented) made with Solidity. Based on specs "https://uniswap.org/docs/v1/" and original Vyper smart contracts "https://github.com/Uniswap/uniswap-v1/blob/master/contracts/uniswap_exchange.vy".

All tests and deployments scripts made with Brownie and Python.
